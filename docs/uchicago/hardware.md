## Interactive Nodes

| Access Protocol | Number of Nodes |
| --- | --- |
| ssh | 4   |
| Jupyter Notebook | 4   |

## Batch Compute (HTCondor)

| Queues | Capacity (cores) | Walltime Limit | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| long | 1520 | 72 Hours | The long queue jobs run on the hyperconverged nodes |
| short | 1280 | 4 Hours | The short queue jobs can run on both the fast compute nodes and the hyperconverged nodes |

## Storage Spaces

| Storage | Type | Capacity | Default Quota | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `/data` | Ceph Filesystem | 4.5PB | 5TB | Storage provided by the batch worker nodes. Two types of disks: spinning disks from hyperconverged nodes form the regular pool (in production), NVMe disks from the fast compute nodes form the fast pool (to be configured) |
| `/cold` | Ceph Filesystem | 4.5PB | 0TB | Cold storage for parking data that needs to be kept around that cannot be placed in an RSE |
| `/home` | NFS filesystem | 19TB | 100GB |     |
| `/scratch` | SSD Local Filesystem | 2TB on the hyperconverged nodes, 6TB on the fast compute nodes | N/A |     |
