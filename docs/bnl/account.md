# Getting Access to BNL

Brookhaven National Lab has two types of accounts.

1. lightweight Federated Identity account for accessing Jupyter instance at BNL SDCC and
2. full SDCC account which includes access to Jupyter as well as ssh access to analysis facility.

## Full SDCC Account

The main site for new user sign-up for a full SDCC account is here:
[BNL New User Account](https://www.sdcc.bnl.gov/information/getting-started/new-user-account)

Applying for a BNL computing account is a multi-step process. You will need to
go through the following steps:

- Register for a Guest Number (if you don't already have a valid Life or Guest
  Number)
    - Same for as if you were going to visit BNL campus
    - Most likely will need to upload photos of identification
    - Non-citizens will need to upload your CV
- Complete CyberSecurity training and Computer Use agreement
- Sign up for a New User Account
    - Complete directly on the BNL New User Account site above

## Lightweight Federated Identity Account

The Federated Identity account is quicker to get and users connect BNL AF
resources only through the Jupyter Hub instance.
BNL now has a Jupyter instance that allows ATLAS members to sign in with their
CERN or SLAC computer credentials.

### Prerequisites

As a prerequisite, you will need to obtain an [ORCID](https://orcid.org) number.
[CERN](https://scientific-info.cern/submit-and-publish/persistent-identifiers/orcid)
encourages all those involved in scholarly communication (i.e. all ATLAS
members) to get an[ ORCID](https://orcid.org). Please use
this[ ](https://orcid.org/register)link to register:
<https://orcid.org/register>

BNL requires multi-factor authentication (MFA) to access these accounts.
Currently Federated accounts from CERN or SLAC are accepted.

If you have an existing SDCC account, you will need to enable MFA for your SDCC
account by following the procedure described here:
<https://www.sdcc.bnl.gov/information/unified-multi-factor-authentication>

You will need to make certain that your CERN account is set up for MFA. See this
link for further details:
<https://security.web.cern.ch/recommendations/en/2FA.shtml>

SLAC also has a multi-factor authentication option. You will need to enroll in
SLAC DUO. Instructions on setting up Two Step Authentication @ SLAC can be here:
<https://www-internal.slac.stanford.edu/twostep/>

It will typically take one to two business days to get a light-weight BNL
Federated ID account.

### Apply for account

To start: connect to
 [https://federated.sdcc.bnl.gov/ ](https://federated.sdcc.bnl.gov/)

You will first come to this authorization page:

![InitialSigninPage.png](InitialSigninPage.png?fileId=25551496#mimetype=image%2Fpng&hasPreview=true)

If you already have an SDCC account, you can use it to log in by entering
username/password on the left side of this page.

To use your CERN login, select the CERN button on the right. This will send you
to a CERN login page (NB: MFA will be required at that point).

Once you have successfully logged in, you will be directed to an account
registration page. On this page, all fields are required, in particular the
ORCID as shown below.

![ORCID.png](ORCID.png?fileId=25551506#mimetype=image%2Fpng&hasPreview=true)

If you have an existing SDCC Account, please select the "Yes" button and enter
your SDCC username. This will help us map your federated login to this existing
account.

Finally, as a verification step, you will be required to enter the designated
point of contact's name. This name must not be shared with anyone outside the
ATLAS collaboration. It can be found here:
<https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/Atlas/BNLJupyter>.

![PointofContact.png](PointofContact.png?fileId=25551526#mimetype=image%2Fpng&hasPreview=true)

Once you submit your account request, you will receive an email from
RT-RACF-UserAccounts@bnl.gov with subject line starting with "**Lightweight User
Account Request for ATLAS Federated ID from** _<your name>_." You will be
informed through the RT ticket via email when your account has been created. At
that point, you will be able to log in with your federated credentials on the
jupyterhub portal at <https://atlas-jupyter.sdcc.bnl.gov/>.
