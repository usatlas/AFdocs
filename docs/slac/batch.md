# Batch System at SLAC

## Submitting SLURM jobs at S3DF

All US ATLAS users can submit batch jobs using Slurm account **atlas:usatlas**,
e.g. `srun -A atlas:usatlas hostname`. The partition to use is `roma` (an HPC
cluster with AMD EPYC 7702 CPUs) and `ampere` (a Nvidia A100 GPU cluster). The
following is a typical script to be used with the `sbatch` command:

```
#!/bin/bash
#
#SBATCH --account=atlas:usatlas
#SBATCH --partition=ampere
#SBATCH --gpus a100:1
#SBATCH --job-name=my_first_job
#SBATCH --output=output-%j.txt
#SBATCH --error=output-%j.txt
#SBATCH --ntasks=1
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=2
#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=4g
#SBATCH --time=0-00:10:00

unset KRB5CCNAME  # <-- this is important

export ATLAS_LOCAL_ROOT_BASE=/cvmfs/atlas.cern.ch/repo/ATLASLocalRootBase

# Use ALRB_CONT_CMDOPTS to provide bind mount, etc. options
export ALRB_CONT_CMDOPTS="-B /sdf,/fs,/lscratch"

# Use ALRB_CONT_RUNPAYLOAD to define the actual job payload
export ALRB_CONT_RUNPAYLOAD="source $HOME/myJobPayload.sh"

# Run the payload in container.
source $ATLAS_LOCAL_ROOT_BASE/user/atlasLocalSetup.sh -c el9 –pwd $PWD

```

Note that S3DF currently disabled submitting to multiple partitions (due to
issues with SLURM accounting). So please avoid submitting jobs using multiple
partitions (e.g. `#SBATCH --partition=roma,ampere`).

# Old obsolete systems

The following describe the soon to be obsolete systems, SDF and older AFS/LSF
facilities. Please migrate to S3DF ASAP as SLAC has set a deadline to
decommission most of the services in these two older facilities around
April 2024.

## Submit SLURM batch job at SDF

The [main page of SDF](https://sdf.slac.stanford.edu) provides
[basic info about using SLURM batch system](https://sdf.slac.stanford.edu/public/doc/#/batch-compute?id=using-slurm).
One of the lines in the example SLURM submission script,
`#SBATCH --partition=shared` allows you to specify "shared" or "usatlas".

ATLAS owns a small fraction of CPU resource in SDF. "usatlas" will give you
guaranteed access to ATLAS owned CPUs but you may have to wait if other ATLAS
users are using them. "shared" allows you to access a large pool of CPUs (own by
others) so the waiting time will likely be shorter. But there is small risk that
your job will be pre-emptied. The rule of thumb is to run short jobs in
"shared", and run long jobs (12h+) in "usatlas".

To request a GPU, add "#SBATCH --gpus=1" to the submission script. All installed
GPUs are Nvidia CUDA GPUs. Since ATLAS currently does not own a GPU at SDF, you
will need to use `#SBATCH --partition=shared` if you request a GPU.

## Submit LSF batch jobs at AFS environment

The following page has many useful info about using the AFS environment,
esepecially with regard to using the LSF batch system.
