# Containers for Machine Learning Work at Analysis Facilities

A new feature at the Analysis Facilities are the inclusion of Jupyter Notebooks
and the option for users to request GPU resources. In a group effort between WBS
2.3 and Physics Support, we have developed tools to ensure that you have all the
necessary packages in order to do your work with minimal effort.

This led to creating
[ML Containers](https://github.com/usatlas/ML-Containers/blob/main/ml-images-ReadMe.md)
that house the basic python packages based on the
[US-ATLAS ML Tutorial 2019](https://github.com/usatlas-ml-training) materials.
