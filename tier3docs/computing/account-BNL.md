# Getting Access to BNL

Brookhaven National Lab has two types of accounts. 1) lightweight Federated
Identity account for accessing Jupyter instance at BNL SDCC and 2) full SDCC
account which includes access to Jupyter as well as ssh access to analysis
facility.

## Lightweight Federated Identity Account

The Federated Identity account is quicker to get and users connect BNL AF
resources only through the Jupyter Hub instance. Further details are found here:
[BNL Federated ID Account](../UserOnboarding/account/BNLFederatedID.md)

## Full SDCC Account

The main site for new user sign-up for a full SDCC account is here:
[BNL New User Account](https://www.sdcc.bnl.gov/information/getting-started/new-user-account)

Applying for a BNL computing account is a multi-step process. You will need to
go through the following steps:

- Register for a Guest Number (if you don't already have a valid Life or Guest
  Number)
  - Same for as if you were going to visit BNL campus
  - Most likely will need to upload photos of identification
  - Non-citizens will need to upload your CV
- Complete CyberSecurity training and Computer Use agreement
- Sign up for a New User Account
  - Complete directly on the BNL New User Account site above
