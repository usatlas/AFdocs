(~15 minutes after upload), you can connect to the facility:

```sh
ssh login.af.uchicago.edu
```

For detailed information on SSH key generation and setup, see our
[SSH Access Guide](../computing/ssh_guide.md).

## SSH Configuration (Optional)

For detailed SSH configuration options including config files and SSH agent
setup, see our [SSH Access Guide](../computing/ssh_guide.md).

### UChicago-Specific SSH Config Example

You can create an SSH config file entry specifically for UChicago to simplify
connections:

```sh
Host uchicago
  HostName login.af.uchicago.edu
  User <your-username>
  ForwardAgent yes
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

Replace `<your-username>` with your actual username. With this configuration,
you can simply run:

```sh
ssh uchicago
```

For more information on SSH config files and adding keys to the SSH agent, see
the [SSH Access Guide](../computing/ssh_guide.md#ssh-configuration-optional)
