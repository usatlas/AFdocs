# Large Language Model Service at SLAC AF

SLAC AF provides an experimental Large Language Model (LLM) service using Ollama. There are two
ways to use the service. You can click the following links to check out the details:

1. [Use a shared Ollama LLM service](./SharedLLMservice.md). This is a lot simpler than 
   running your own.
2. [Run your own Ollama LLM service](./RunYourOwnOllama.md). You have a lot more flexibility
   and control.
