## User instructions for obtaining a BNL Federated ID Account

BNL now has a Jupyter instance that allows ATLAS members to sign in with their
CERN or SLAC computer credentials.

### Prerequisites

As a prerequisite, you will need to obtain an [ORCID](https://orcid.org) number.
[CERN](https://scientific-info.cern/submit-and-publish/persistent-identifiers/orcid)
encourages all those involved in scholarly communication (i.e. all ATLAS
members) to get an[ ORCID](https://orcid.org). Please use
this[ ](https://orcid.org/register)link to register:
<https://orcid.org/register>

BNL requires multi-factor authentication (MFA) to access these accounts.
Currently Federated accounts from CERN or SLAC are accepted.

If you have an existing SDCC account, you will need to enable MFA for your SDCC
account by following the procedure described here:
<https://www.sdcc.bnl.gov/information/unified-multi-factor-authentication>

You will need to make certain that your CERN account is set up for MFA. See this
link for further details:
<https://security.web.cern.ch/recommendations/en/2FA.shtml>

SLAC also has a multi-factor authentication option. You will need to enroll in
SLAC DUO. Instructions on setting up Two Step Authentication @ SLAC can be here:
<https://www-internal.slack.stanford.edu/twostep/>

It will typically take one to two business days to get a light-weight BNL
Federated ID account.

### Apply for account

To start: connect to
 [https://federated.sdcc.bnl.gov/ ](https://federated.sdcc.bnl.gov/)

You will first come to this authorization page:

If you already have an SDCC account, you can use it to log in by entering
username/password on the left side of this page.

To use your CERN login, select the CERN button on the right. This will send you
to a CERN login page (NB: MFA will be required at that point).

Once you have successfully logged in, you will be directed to an account
registration page. On this page, all fields are required, in particular the
ORCID as shown below.

If you have an existing SDCC Account, please select the "Yes" button and enter
your SDCC username. This will help us map your federated login to this existing
account.

Finally, as a verification step, you will be required to enter the designated
point of contact's name. This name must not be shared with anyone outside the
ATLAS collaboration. It can be found here:
<https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/Atlas/BNLJupyter>.

Once you submit your account request, you will receive an email from
RT-RACF-UserAccounts@bnl.gov with subject line starting with "**Lightweight User
Account Request for ATLAS Federated ID from** _<your name>_." You will be
informed through the RT ticket via email when your account has been created. At
that point, you will be able to log in with your federated credentials on the
jupyterhub portal at <https://atlas-jupyter.sdcc.bnl.gov/>.
