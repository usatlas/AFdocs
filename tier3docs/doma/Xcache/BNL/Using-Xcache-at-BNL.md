## <span id="Use_the_Xcache_servers"></span> Use the Xcache servers

Both BNL and SLAC have set up the **Xcache servers**, to help cache locally the
file on the grid or **CERN EOS**. Currently there are 60TB on the BNL Xcache
server, and 20TB on the SLAC Xcache server.

The Xcache servers

- provide **rucioN2N feature**, enabling users to access any files on the grid
  without knowing its exact site location and the file path.
- and help **cache locally** the content of remote files actually read in the
  first access, thus improves the read performance for sequential access. If
  only partial content of a file is read, then only that part would cached.

You can run the predefined command **Xcache_ls.py** to generate a clist file
(containing a list of physicsl file paths) for given datasets, then use the
clist in your jobs.

Please **click the following arrow** to see the full usage of Xcache_ls.py.

run **Xcache_ls.py -h** to get the full usage

However, for large file inputs on the grid, you are recommended to plan ahead
and pre-stage them to BNL using
[R2D2 request](https://rucio-ui.cern.ch/r2d2/manage_quota) or rucio command.
