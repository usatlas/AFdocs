## Data Sharing Store at SLAC

US ATLAS is experimenting a data sharing store service at SLAC AF. The goal is
to enable easy data sharing with your ATLAS colleagues.

### Features

This is an object store with the following features:

1. Allows ATLAS users to upload/delete files using `root` or `https` protocols.
   Anyone can download a file (see Privacy section). This service is not limited
   to US ATLAS.
2. Files uploaded there have a lifetime of N-days. After that period, they will
   be purged without notice. Currently N is set to 60 at SLAC AF.
3. The top level directory in the object store is not browsable.

The object store is available at the following URLs.

`https://sdf-dtn10.slack.stanford.edu:2094/share` (or) <br>
`root://sdf-dtn10.slack.stanford.edu:2094//share` (double slash after :2094)

### Privacy

Browsing/Listing of '/share' is disabled in order to provide a level of privacy
that is suitable for sharing <b>`low sensitivity data`</b>. For example, if one
copies a data file to

`https://sdf-dtn10.slack.stanford.edu:2094/share/random-string/myfile.dat`

Others would not know the existence of `myfile.dat` unless they were told about
the `random-string`. This is because `/share` is not searchable. As the owner,
you should write down the random string and keep it secure. Anyone who know the
random string can search for the content under it.

If you lose the random string, you lose access to your data Administrators won't
be able to help you since there is no records of ownership in the object store.
The data will eventually be pured after expiration.

### Upload and Download

You will need an X509 proxy with ATLAS VOMS attribute to upload and delete. No
such requirement for downloading, though some tools will insist to have a X509
proxy before proceeding. So run command `voms-proxy-init -voms atlas` first to
obtain an X509 proxy with ATLAS VOMS attribute.

Then if you will upload, think of a hard-to-guest random string to be used after
`/share`. One secure way to generate a random string is to use Unix command
`uuidgen`, and write it down!

There are three set of tools that can be used to upload/download/delete a file.
In addition, you can also use your web browser to download.

#### Using curl to update/download/delete

curl is available everywhere. To use curl, follow these steps

1. Create an alias to type less:
   <br>`alias mycurl="curl -E /tmp/x509up_u$(id -u) --cacert /tmp/x509up_u$(id -u) --capath /etc/grid-security/certificates"`.
   <br>You may need to adjust the proxy location and CA directory location
   (/etc/grid-security/certificates) in your environment.
2. Upload:
   <br>`mycurl -L -X PUT --upload-file /tmp/mydata.file https://sdf-dtn10.slack.stanford.edu:2094/share/random-string/myfile.dat`
3. Download:
   <br>`mycurl -L -X GET https://sdf-dtn10.slack.stanford.edu:2094/share/random-string/myfile.dat`
4. Delete:
   <br>`mycurl -L -X DELETE https://sdf-dtn10.slack.stanford.edu:2094/share/random-string/myfile.dat`

#### Use gfal2 tools to upload/download/delete

You may need to setup the ATLAS environment (run `localSetupRucioClients`) to
have the gfal2 tools in your PATH.

1. Upload:
   <br>`gfal-copy -f /tmp/myfile.dat https://sdf-dtn10.slack.stanford.edu:2094/share/random-string/myfile.dat`
2. Download:
   <br>`gfal-copy -f https://sdf-dtn10.slack.stanford.edu:2094/share/random-string/myfile.dat /tmp/myfile.dat`
3. Delete:
   <br>`gfal-rm https://sdf-dtn10.slack.stanford.edu:2094/share/random-string/myfile.dat`
4. You can even do
   `gfal-copy -f https://cern.ch//SCRATCHDISK/myfile.dat https://sdf-dtn10.slack.stanford.edu:2094/share/random-string/myfile.dat`

Gfal2 tools work with both https and root protocols. In the last example, the
source and destination can use different protocols.

#### Use xrootd tools to upload/download/delete

You may need to setup the ATLAS environment (run `localSetupRucioClients`) to
have the xrootd tools in your PATH. These tools will mostly work with the root
protocol. Note that in a root URL, there is usually a double slash after the
port number.

1. Upload:
   <br>`xrdcp -f /tmp/myfile.dat root://sdf-dtn10.slack.stanford.edu:2094//share/random-string/myfile.dat`
2. Download:
   <br>`xrdcp -f root://sdf-dtn10.slack.stanford.edu:2094//share/random-string/myfile.dat /tmp/myfile.dat`
3. Delete:
   <br>`xrdfs root://sdf-dtn10.slack.stanford.edu:2094 rm /share/random-string/myfile.dat /tmp/myfile.dat`
4. You can also do
   `xrdcp -f root://cern.ch//SCRATCHDISK/myfile.dat root://sdf-dtn10.slack.stanford.edu:2094//share/random-string/myfile.dat /tmp/myfile.dat`

With additional setting, xrdcp also works with the https protocol.

#### Use a web browser

You can use a web browser to download file and list a directory (except the top
level, which is not browsable). To do that, just paste the https URL to your
browser.

It is not possible to use a web browser for upload and deletion.
