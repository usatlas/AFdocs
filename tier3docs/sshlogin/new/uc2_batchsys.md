## Using the batch system at UChicago
The UChicago Analysis Facility uses [HTCondor](https://htcondor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users-manual/index.html) for batch workloads. 
In a nutshell, to submit a job you will need to create an executable script and
a submit file that describes your job.

### Before submitting to the Analysis Facility

Before submitting a large number of tasks to the batch system, it is important
to understand a few things about your workloads and how they might best fit the
available resources of the Analysis Facility. 

Some prerequisites to consider before submitting workloads to the Analysis
Facility:
<ul>
<li><input  disabled="" type="checkbox"> Which filesystem should be used to submit my jobs?</li>
<li><input  disabled="" type="checkbox"> Should my job(s) be submitted to the short or the long queue?</li>
<li><input  disabled="" type="checkbox"> How much memory request does my Job(s) need?</li>
<li><input  disabled="" type="checkbox"> Check all my jobs requirements</li>
<li><input  disabled="" type="checkbox"> Always check my jobs status</li>
</ul>


-  #### Which filesystem to use
Your account on the UChicago Analysis Facility will be allocated space on the
`$HOME` and `$DATA` filesystems when your account is approved. By
default, we give each user 100GB of storage on the `$HOME` filesystem (i.e.,
`/home/<username>`). This filesystem is backed up weekly and is more optimized
for small files such as job logs, submit files, code and so on.

Data files, on the other hand, should be placed in the `$DATA` filesystem
(`/data/<username>`) which is more suitable for large files but is **not**
backed up. By default, you will be given a 5TB quota on this filesystem. If you
are working on an analysis that requires more local storage, please reach out
to us at **atlas-us-chicago-tier3-admins@cern.ch** and we'll do our best to
accomodate your request.

Finally, jobs submitted to HTCondor will be assigned to a server with one or
more dedicated high-speed "scratch" disks to use as working space when
processing your jobs, each with a few TB of available space. This is important
for two reasons:

- The scratch disk is _local_. We strongly recommend that you copy your input
   data from `$DATA` to `$SCRATCH` when running a job because this will
   generally deliver the best performance.
- The scratch disk is _ephemeral_. HTCondor will automatically clean up the
   scratch disk for the next workload when your job has finished using it. 

**With this in mind, you will need to make sure that you copy your output data
away from the $SCRATCH filesystem and into the $DATA filesystem at the end of
your job. Any data left in $SCRATCH will be lost at the end of your job!
When submitting jobs, you should try to use the scratch disk whenever possible.
This will help you be a "good neighbor" to other users on the system, and
reduce overall stress on the shared filesystems, which can lead to slowness,
downtimes, etc.**

To summarize, please review the following table:

| Filesystem | Best for ...                  | Backup  | Access from ...    | Default Quota |
| ---------  | ----------------------------  | ------- | ------------------ | ------------- |
| $HOME      | Code, Logs, Submit files      | Weekly  | SSH, Jupyter, Jobs | 100GB         |
| $DATA      | ROOT files, other large files | None    | SSH, Jupyter, Jobs | 5TB           |
| $SCRATCH   | Transient job files           | None    | Jobs only          | No quota      |


Consider the following example: Data is read from Rucio, we pretend to process
it, and then push a small output back to the `$DATA` filesystem. It assumes
your X509 proxy certificate is valid and in your home directory.

We create our executable file:
```
#!/bin/bash
export ATLAS_LOCAL_ROOT_BASE=/cvmfs/atlas.cern.ch/repo/ATLASLocalRootBase
export ALRB_localConfigDir=$HOME/localConfig
source ${ATLAS_LOCAL_ROOT_BASE}/user/atlasLocalSetup.sh
lsetup rucio
rucio --verbose download --rse MWT2_DATADISK data16_13TeV:AOD.11071822._001488.pool.root.1

# You can run things like asetup as well
asetup AnalysisBase,21.2.81

# This is where you would do your data analysis via AnalysisBase, etc. We will
# just pretend to do that, and truncate the file to simulate generating an
# output file. This is definitely not what you want to do in a real analysis!
cd data16_13TeV
truncate --size 10MB AOD.11071822._001488.pool.root.1
cp AOD.11071822._001488.pool.root.1 $DATA/myjob.output
sleep 300
```
Followed by our submission file:
```
Universe = vanilla

Output = myjob.$(Cluster).$(Process).out
Error = myjob.$(Cluster).$(Process).err
Log = myjob.log

Executable = myjob.sh

use_x509userproxy = true
x509userproxy = /home/<username>/x509proxy

request_memory = 1GB
request_cpus = 1

Queue 1
```

It gets submitted in the usual way:
```
$ condor_submit myjob.sub
Submitting job(s).
1 job(s) submitted to cluster 17.
```

- #### The Short and the Long queues.

Before submitting jobs you should have an idea about how long the job will take to finish (not the exact time but an approximate).
In `HTCondor` we added a feature called `shortqueue` with dedicated workers that will ONLY service jobs that run for less than **4 hours**.
To make use of the shortqueue you just have to add the following configuration parameter to your job submit file.

```bash
+queue="short"
```
If your job is longer than 4 hours just exclude this configuration parameter from your submit file and your jobs will be sent to the `long-queue` automatically, otherwise your job will be placed on hold until you remove it or release it (check HTCondor commmands).

☆ﾟ.* Important: Using this -short queue- for -short jobs- when possible is essential for the use of the available resources, specially to let the -long queue- available for -long jobs-. *. ﾟ☆.

- #### Job memory request
How much memory does your job need to run? 

#### How to submit jobs
 You will need to define an executable script and a "submit" file that describes your job. A simple job that loads the ATLAS environment looks something like this:

Job script, called myjob.sh:

```
#!/bin/bash
export ATLAS_LOCAL_ROOT_BASE=/cvmfs/atlas.cern.ch/repo/ATLASLocalRootBase
export ALRB_localConfigDir=$HOME/localConfig
source ${ATLAS_LOCAL_ROOT_BASE}/user/atlasLocalSetup.sh
# at this point, you can lsetup root, rucio, athena, etc..
```
Submit file, called myjob.sub:
```
Universe = vanilla

Output = myjob.$(Cluster).$(Process).out
Error = myjob.$(Cluster).$(Process).err
Log = myjob.log

Executable = myjob.sh

request_memory = 1GB
request_cpus = 1

Queue 1
```
The condor_submit command is used to queue jobs:
```
$ condor_submit myjob.sub
Submitting job(s).
1 job(s) submitted to cluster 17.
```
And the condor_q command is used to view the queue:
```
[lincolnb@login01 ~]$ condor_q

```
### Configuring your jobs to use an X509 Proxy Certificate

If you need to use an X509 Proxy, e.g. to access ATLAS Data, you will want to copy your X509 certificate to the Analysis Facility. If you need a reminder, information can be found in [this link.](https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/AtlasComputing/WorkBookStartingGrid)

Store your certificate in ```$HOME/.globus``` and create a ATLAS VOMS proxy in the usual way:
```
export ATLAS_LOCAL_ROOT_BASE=/cvmfs/atlas.cern.ch/repo/ATLASLocalRootBase
export ALRB_localConfigDir=$HOME/localConfig
source ${ATLAS_LOCAL_ROOT_BASE}/user/atlasLocalSetup.sh
lsetup emi
voms-proxy-init -voms atlas -out $HOME/x509proxy
```
You will want to generate the proxy on, or copy it to, the shared $HOME filesystem so that the HTCondor scheduler can find and read the proxy. With the following additions to your jobscript, HTCondor will configure the job enviroment automatically for X509 authenticated data access:
```
use_x509userproxy = true
# Replacing <username> with your own username
x509userproxy = /home/<username>/x509proxy
```
E.g., in the job above for the user lincolnb:
```
Universe = vanilla

Output = myjob.$(Cluster).$(Process).out
Error = myjob.$(Cluster).$(Process).err
Log = myjob.log

Executable = myjob.sh

use_x509userproxy = true
x509userproxy = /home/lincolnb/x509proxy

request_memory = 1GB
request_cpus = 1

Queue 1
```
