## HTCondor user's guide
### Use condor within eventloop
If you are using EventLoop to submit your code to the Condor batch system you should replace your submission driver line with something like the following:

```bash
EL::CondorDriver driver;
job.options()->setString(EL::Job::optCondorConf, "getenv = true\naccounting_group = group_atlas.<institute>");
driver.submitOnly( job, "yourJobName”);
```
