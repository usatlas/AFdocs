# S3DF: a new computing environment at SLAC

For decades, SLAC runs a high throughput computing (HTC) environment, primarily
serving the HEP community. This environment feature AFS file system home
directory and LSF batch system, along with CVMFS. This environment is also known
as the AFS environment.

SLAC is now building a new computing environment: the SLAC Shared Scientific
Data Facility (S3DF). The core componments of S3DF are an interactive pool, an
OpenOnDemain web portal, a high throughput computer cluster (HTC), with a subset
being a HPC cluster and a GPU cluster - both managed by a single SLURM batch
system, and storage clusters

## Accessing to S3DF

There are two ways to login to S3DF.

- **SSH login** (using SLAC Unix password)
  1. Login to the bastion host `ssh <username>@s3dflogin.slack.stanford.edu`
  2. Then login to the actual interactive pool node `ssh iana` to do your work.
- **Login to S3DF web portal**
  - Go to https://s3df.slack.stanford.edu/ondemand and login to via Jupyter or a
    terminal. You will land on a batch node.

S3DF also have a few data transfer nodes (s3dfdtn.slack.stanford.edu) for
interactive data transfers. Note that all nodes in S3DF, except the bastion
nodes and DTN nodes above, are in private network IP space. There are limited
NAT capacity to reach to the outside from these interactive and batch nodes.
There is no inbound network connection to the interactive and batch nodes.

### OS environment

S3DF currently runs RHEL-8. However, ATLAS recommended OS is AlmaLinux 9 (and
previously RHEL7/CentOS7). Apptainer container package is available on all S3DF
nodes to help users who need to run their codes under a different OS
environment. For example, to bring up an ATLAS provided AlmaLinux 9 environment
in a container on an interactive node:

1. Add the following to `$HOME/.bashrc` and re-login

```
  function setupATLAS()
  {
    export ATLAS_LOCAL_ROOT_BASE=/cvmfs/atlas.cern.ch/repo/ATLASLocalRootBase
    export ALRB_CONT_CMDOPTS="-B /sdf,/fs"
    source $ATLAS_LOCAL_ROOT_BASE/user/atlasLocalSetup.sh $@
    return $?
  }
```

2. Start an ATLAS environment in an AlmaLinux 9 container

```
  setupATLAS -c el9
```

For more info on this topic, especially how to do this in batch jobs, please
refer to
[ATLAS Canada Twiki](https://twiki.atlas-canada.ca/bin/view/AtlasCanada/Containers)

### Submitting SLURM jobs

All US ATLAS users can submit batch jobs using Slurm account **atlas:usatlas**,
e.g. `srun -A atlas:usatlas hostname`. The partition to use is `roma` (an HPC
cluster with AMD EPYC 7702 CPUs) and `ampere` (a Nvidia A100 GPU cluster). The
following is a typical script to be used with the `sbatch` command:

```
#!/bin/bash
#
#SBATCH --account=atlas:usatlas
#SBATCH --partition=ampere
#SBATCH --gpus a100:1
#SBATCH --job-name=my_first_job
#SBATCH --output=output-%j.txt
#SBATCH --error=output-%j.txt
#SBATCH --ntasks=1
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=2
#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=4g
#SBATCH --time=0-00:10:00

unset KRB5CCNAME  # <-- this is important

export ATLAS_LOCAL_ROOT_BASE=/cvmfs/atlas.cern.ch/repo/ATLASLocalRootBase

# Use ALRB_CONT_CMDOPTS to provide bind mount, etc. options
export ALRB_CONT_CMDOPTS="-B /sdf,/fs,/lscratch"

# Use ALRB_CONT_RUNPAYLOAD to define the actual job payload
export ALRB_CONT_RUNPAYLOAD="source $HOME/myJobPayload.sh”

# Run the payload in container.
source $ATLAS_LOCAL_ROOT_BASE/user/atlasLocalSetup.sh -c el9 –pwd $PWD

```

Note that S3DF currently disabled submitting to multiple partitions (due to
issues with SLURM accounting). So please avoid submitting jobs using multiple
partitions (e.g. `#SBATCH --partition=roma,ampere`).

### Setup ATLAS environment

A typical way to setup ATLAS environment upon login is to put the following in
$HOME/.bashrc. This is the same at both AFS and SDF.

```
export RUCIO_ACCOUNT="change_me"
export ATLAS_LOCAL_ROOT_BASE=/cvmfs/atlas.cern.ch/repo/ATLASLocalRootBase
alias setupATLAS='source $ATLAS_LOCAL_ROOT_BASE/user/atlasLocalSetup.sh'
...
```

## Available Storage

On the storage side, S3DF provides

<ol>
  <li> Several  Weka parallel Posix file systems for user home and data. At the backend and ,
invisible and transparent to the users, each of these storage system consists of a NVMe cache of a few PB,
and a spinning disk backed CEPH s3 object storage. All the file system metadata reside in the NVMe cache.
  <li> The S3DF also mounted a Lustre file system that was previously used by the SDF system (S3DF's predecesssor).
  <li> GPFS and AFS from the older faclities are mounted read-only on a few interactive login nodes to facilitate
data migration
  <li> CVMFS is available on all interactive and batch nodes.
</ol>

### Space available to the ATLAS users

The following spaces are available to ATLAS users:

<ol>
  <li> $HOME: quota 25GB on Weka file system
  <li> /sdf/data/atlas/u/&lt;username>: quota 200GB on Weka file system
  <li> /sdf/scratch/users/&lt;username_intial>/&lt;username>: quota 100GB on Weka file system. This is a scratch space. Data
are subject to purge when the total scratch space is full.
  <li> /fs/ddn/sdf/group/atlas/d/&lt;username>: create your own dir please. This is a Lustre file system (it is also
available in the old SDF facility at /sdf/group/atlas/d). It is fast
for bulk data access, but is not suitable for software. There is currently no easy way to enforce quota on this
file system. Please try to keep your usage under 2TB if possible <p>
  <li> /sdf/group/atlas: quota 10TB on Weka file system shared by all users, for groups to storage software but not data.
(Note that this is a new space at S3DF. It has nothing to do with the above SDF space /sdf/group/atlas)
  <li> /sdf/scratch/atlas: 5TB shared scratch space, subject to purge.
  <li> /lscratch on batch nodes, 300GB-7TB (depend on nodes).
</ol>

For existing users, you may notice that the old AFS and GPFS spaces are no
longer availalb at S3DF (except read-only on a few interactive nodes). AFS and
GPFS will be decommissioned soon at SLAC. Please move your data in AFS and GPFS
space to the above spaces.

The best tool to copy your data from AFS/GPFS to S3DF spaces is probably the
unix `cp -r -p` command. `rsync` is also a good and easy to use tool. Copying
data may take days. So you may want to run your `cp` or `rsync` inside a
`screen` session.

### Migration from older faculity to S3DF

Please refer to the following slides for plan and resentation about the
migration.

# Old obsolete systems

The following describe the soon to be obsolete systems, SDF and older AFS/LSF
facilities. Please migrate to S3DF ASAP as SLAC has set a deadline to
decommission most of the services in these two older facilities around
April 2024.

## <a name="sdf"></a>SSH login to SDF

`ssh <username>@sdf-login.slack.stanford.edu`

SLAC has two different computer accounts, unix and Windows. Please use your
Windows account password to login. You may ask: What if I only have a unix
account, and do not have a SLAC Windows account? Continue reading.

SDF uses a new identity management system (aka <span style="color:red">"SLAC
ID"</span> - it will be a computer account to login to everything at SLAC). If
you already have a SLAC Windows account, you are all set (SLAC ID = SLAC Windows
account) and go to the next step. If you don't have a SLAC Windows account,
please go to
[SLAC SDF page and click "Accounts Portal"](https://sdf.slack.stanford.edu/public/doc/#/accounts-and-access?id=access).
After this, give it a hour for the changes to be propagated through SLAC
computing.

## Submit SLURM batch job at SDF

The above URL is actually [the main page of SDF](https://sdf.slack.stanford.edu)
(login info at the upper half of the page, and user document at the lower half
of the page). At there you can also find
[the basic info about using SLURM batch system](https://sdf.slack.stanford.edu/public/doc/#/batch-compute?id=using-slurm).
One of the lines in the example SLURM submission script,
`#SBATCH --partition=shared` allows you to specify "shared" or "usatlas".

ATLAS owns a small fraction of CPU resource in SDF. "usatlas" will give you
guaranteed access to ATLAS owned CPUs but you may have to wait if other ATLAS
users are using them. "shared" allows you to access a large pool of CPUs (own by
others) so the waiting time will likely be shorter. But there is small risk that
your job will be pre-emptied. The rule of thumb is to run short jobs in
"shared", and run long jobs (12h+) in "usatlas".

To request a GPU, add "#SBATCH --gpus=1" to the submission script. All installed
GPUs are Nvidia CUDA GPUs. Since ATLAS currently does not own a GPU at SDF, you
will need to use `#SBATCH --partition=shared` if you request a GPU.

## SSH login to the AFS environment and submit LSF batch jobs

`ssh <username>@centos7.slack.stanford.edu`

You should use unix account password to login. Note that as SLAC retires the AFS
environment in the next few years, this type of account (unix) may disappear.

The following page has many useful info about using the AFS environment,
esepecially with regard to using the LSF batch system.

https://confluence.slack.stanford.edu/display/Atlas/SLAC+Analysis+Computing+Facility

## Remote X-windows access

SLAC currently provides
[Fast-X](https://confluence.slack.stanford.edu/display/SCSPub/FastX) for
accelerated X-window access. Fast-X maybe useful when you are far away from SLAC
(geographically, or over a high latency network) and you want to diaply your
ROOT 2-D or 3-D/scatter plot. You should use SLAC unix username and password to
login to Fast-X. Once you are on Fast-X, you can `ssh -Y` to SDF or AFS login
nodes.

Note that upon login to Fast-X, you may find some space that you can save a few
files. Do NOT use this space for anything. This space is not your main GPFS or
Lustre storage, it is not accessible from the AFS or SDF environment. It is also
subject to deletion without notice.

SLAC is investigating [NoMachine](https://www.nomachine.com) as a replacement of
Fast-X.
