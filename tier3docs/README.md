# Public Documentation for US ATLAS Analysis Facilities

!!! warning "Privacy Disclaimer"

    US ATLAS documents and code samples hosted at this GitHub organization are visible to the general public. Please do not put personal identifiable information, usernames and passwords and methods to access restricted US ATLAS and ATLAS (international) resources in this area.

US ATLAS hosts three shared Tier 3 computing spaces at BNL, SLAC, and UChicago,
also known as Analysis Facilities (AF). These three facilities are available to
all US ATLAS physicists and computer scientists. They are organized and managed
to support US ATLAS users' need for computing resources including login, run
interactive and batch jobs, access ATLAS data, store private data, etc.

</p>

The AFs also support a wide variety of tools specific for analysis, including
ATLAS/CERN software in CVMFS, Grid middleware, Rucio clients, Machine Learning
packages, MPI, Jupyter Lab with PyROOT, Xcache with auto data discovery, GPUs,
etc. The three facilities are backed by staff to support software environments,
unix systems and storage.
