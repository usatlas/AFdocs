# Public Documentation for US ATLAS Analysis Facilities

US ATLAS hosts three shared Tier 3 computing spaces at BNL, SLAC, and UChicago, also known as Analysis Facilities (AF). These
three facilities are available to all US ATLAS physicists and computer scientists. They are
organized and managed to support US ATLAS users' need for computing resources including login,
run interactive and batch jobs, access ATLAS data, store private data, etc. Visualization for said support can be viewed [here](https://atlas-kibana.mwt2.org:5601/s/analysis-facility/app/dashboards#/view/8bb58440-6145-11ed-afcf-d91dad577662?_g=(filters:!())).

<br><br>
The AFs also support a wide variety of tools specific for analysis, including ATLAS/CERN
software in CVMFS, Grid middleware, Rucio clients, Machine Learning packages, MPI, Jupyter
Lab with PyROOT, Xcache with auto data discovery, GPUs, etc.
<br><br>
The three facilities are backed by staff to support software environments, unix systems and
storage.</span>
