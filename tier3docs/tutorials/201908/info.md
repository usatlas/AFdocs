# A tutorial of analysis example at Tier3s of BNL/SLAC

This tutorial demonstrates how to set up, build, run jobs interactively and on
batch system at Shared T3s of BNL/SLAC.

The analysis example is only a skeleton, making 2 plots out of input DAOD files,
and printing progress for every 100 events.

You can find the details at:

- Running this example at **[BNL](bnl.md "Running at BNL")**
- Running this example at **[SLAC](slack.md "Running at SLAC")**

If you do not care much about turnover speed, you can submit the jobs to the
grid. You can find the [brief instruction](grid.md "Running at Grid").
