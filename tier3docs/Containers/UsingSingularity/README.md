# <span id="Introduction"></span> Introduction

## <span id="What_are_Containers"></span> What are Containers?

**Containers** are an operating system virtualization technology used to package
applications and their dependencies and run them in isolated environments.
Unlike Virtual Machines, they share the host OS kernel, thus provide a
**lightweight** method of packaging and deploying applications in a standardized
way across many different types of infrastructure.

## <span id="What_is_Singularity"></span> What is Singularity?

**[Singularity](https://sylabs.io/)** is a container platform. It allows you to
create and run containers that package up pieces of software in a portable and
reproducible way. In contrast to **[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/)**,
Singularity does not give superuser privileges. And it can access to the GPU on
a host node in native speed.

You can build a container using Singularity on your laptop, and then run it on
the grid. You can also make use of many already existing container images from
different sources.

# <span id="Installation_of_Singularity"></span> Installation of Singularity

## <span id="Singularity_on_Linux_OS"></span> Singularity on Linux OS

Most Linux Distros should come with the Singularity. For example, Singularity is
already available on BNL/SLAC machines.

    cent7a(SLAC)$ singularity --version
    singularity version 3.5.3-1.1.el7

    attsub01(BNL)$ singularity --version
    2.6.1-dist

If it does not come with your Linux OS, you can find the installation
instruction for the version of 3.5 (the latest one currently):

<https://sylabs.io/guides/3.5/admin-guide/installation.html>

The singularity maintained in Linux distribution repos (via apt or yum) tends to
be older. If you like to install the latest version, you can visit
[the gitlab source site](https://github.com/sylabs/singularity/releases) to
install from the source.

## <span id="Singularity_on_Mac_OS"></span> Singularity on Mac OS

Since Mac OS does not use Linux kernel, the Singularity for Linux does not work
here. However, a new Singularity Desktop for Mac OS has been developed to take
Linux-based containers. The installation instruction can be found
[here](https://sylabs.io/singularity-desktop-macos/). It is still a beta
release, and distributed as a DMG file (Mac OS disk image). The current beta
release version is:

    MacOS$ singularity --version
    singularity version 3.3.0-rc.1.658.g7427b73f1.dirty

As stated on the page of
[Singularity Desktop MacOS](https://sylabs.io/singularity-desktop-macos/), there
are some limitations.

Run **singularity -h** to find the full available commands and options. In
comparison with the Singularity-3.5 on Linux, the Singularity on Mac OS misses
many commands such as **inspect** and **instance**.

## <span id="Singularity_on_Windows"></span> Singularity on Windows

In order to use Singularity on Windows, you need install a Linux distro first.
It could be achieved through
[Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/faq)
without involving a Virtual Machine. **WSL** is a new Windows 10 feature that
enables you to run native Linux command-line tools directly on Windows. So it is
not available for other old Windows such as Windows 7.

### <span id="Installation_of_Windows_Subsyste"></span> Installation of Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

Please refer
[the WSL installation guide for Windows 10/11](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

First enable the option feature **Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux**. Open
**PowerShell as Administrator** and run:

    Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux

When prompted restart the computer.

Then you can install your preferred Linux Distro, following
[the link on the Microsoft store](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10),
where there is no CentOS available. However, you can find the installation guide
for CentOS at
[TipsMake.com](https://tipsmake.com/install-centos-on-windows-10-wsl). Or
download directly [the zip file at github](https://github.com/yuk7/CentWSL) and
following the instruction to install it.

Once your distro has been downloaded and installed, you will be prompted to
**create a new user account** together with its password to
[initialize the new Linux distro](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/initialize-distro).

### <span id="Running_Windows_build"></span> Running Windows 10 build 19041 or higher or Windows 11

In order to install WSL2, ensure that you must be running Windows 10...

- For x64 systems: Version 1903 or later, with Build 18362.1049 or later.
- For ARM64 systems: Version 2004 or later, with Build 19041 or later.

or Windows 11.

You can check your Windows version by opening **Command Prompt** and running the
**ver** command.

>     Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.19045.3803]
>     (c) 2020 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
>
>     C:\Users\Shuwei>ver
>
>     Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.19045.3803]

Actually the Windows build information has already be displayed on the terminal
top when the **Command Prompt** app is opened.

You can also check the Windows build info in PowerShell with command
**systeminfo**:

>     PS C:\Users\Shuwei> systeminfo | Select-String "^OS Name","^OS Version"
>
>     OS Name:                   Microsoft Windows 10 Home Insider Preview
>     OS Version:                10.0.19045 N/A Build 19045

If your Windows build is lower than **18362** (for x64 systems) or 19041 (for
ARM64 systems), you can use the
[Windows Update Assistant](https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows10)
to update your version of Windows.

### <span id="Installation_of_WSL2"></span> Installation of WSL2

You can find
[the detailed instruction on installing WSL2 on Windows](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).
The first 2 requirements have already been discussed above. Next you need:

- Enable the 'Virtual Machine Platform' optional component
- Set a distro to be backed by WSL2 using the command line
- Verify what versions of WSL your distros are using

To Enable the **Virtual Machine Platform**, run **PowerShell as Administrator**
with:

    dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart
    dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart

Then restart the computer.

Next set the Linux dsitro to WSL2 by the following command under **PowerShell**:

    wsl --set-default-version 2

which may take a while to apply.

Now you can verify which WSL version used the Linux distro.

>     PS C:\Users\Shuwei> wsl -v
>     WSL version: 2.0.9.0
>     Kernel version: 5.15.133.1-1
>     WSLg version: 1.0.59
>     MSRDC version: 1.2.4677
>     Direct3D version: 1.611.1-81528511
>     DXCore version: 10.0.25131.1002-220531-1700.rs-onecore-base2-hyp
>     Windows version: 10.0.19045.3803

### <span id="Linux_Distro_Installation_on_Windows"></span> Linux Distribution Installation on Windows

Running `wsl -l --online` in either **PowerShell** or **Command Prompt** to list
the available Linux Disibution Systems.

>     PS C:\Users\yesw> wsl -l --online
>     The following is a list of valid distributions that can be installed.
>     Install using 'wsl.exe --install <Distro>'.
>
>     NAME                                   FRIENDLY NAME
>     Ubuntu                                 Ubuntu
>     Debian                                 Debian GNU/Linux
>     kali-linux                             Kali Linux Rolling

>     SUSE-Linux-Enterprise-15-SP5           SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 SP5
>     openSUSE-Tumbleweed                    openSUSE Tumbleweed

There are Linux Distribution Systems for WSL2 available in the
[Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com), such as _AlmaLinux_.

To install _Ubuntu_, just run `wsl --install Ubuntu`.

To install _AlmaLinux9_, find the corresponding app in the **Microsoft Store**,
install it.

#### <span id="Namservers_in_WSL2_Linux"></span> Nameservers in WSL2 Linux

In case the Windows machine is **behind a campus firewall**, the automatically
generated file _/etc/resolv.conf_ would not work properly. In the case, you need
override the file _/etc/resolv.conf_, which is actually a sym-link to
_/mnt/wsl/resolv.conf_ by default.

Step-1: Inside the WSL2 Linux, run `ipconfig.exe /all | grep -A1 "DNS Servers"`
to find the nameservrs on the host.

>     AlmaLinux9$ ipconfig.exe /all | grep -A1 "DNS Servers"
>     DNS Servers . . . . . . . . . . . : 130.199.128.31
>                                         130.199.1.1
>     --
>     DNS Servers . . . . . . . . . . . : fec0:0:0:ffff::1%1
>                                         fec0:0:0:ffff::2%1

Step-2: Remove the sym-linked file _/etc/resolv.conf_, then create a new file
with **the above IPv4 DNS servers**.

>     AlmaLinux9$ sudo rm -f /etc/resolv.conf
>     AlmaLinux9$ sudo cat >/etc/resolv.conf
>     nameserver 130.199.128.31
>     nameserver  130.199.1.1

Step-3: Create a new file _/etc/wsl.conf_ with the following content, to prevent
overrding _/etc/resolv.conf_ during WSL2 restart.

>     AlmaLinux9$ sudo cat > /etc/wsl.conf
>     [network]
>     generateResolvConf = false

### <span id="Use_the_Installed_Linux_on_Windo"></span> Use the Installed Linux on Windows

Open **PowerShell under a regular user** and run **wsl**:

>     PS C:\Users\Shuwei> wsl
>     yesw2000@Home-Dell660:/mnt/c/Users/Shuwei$ echo $0
>     -bash
>     yesw2000@Home-Dell660:/mnt/c/Users/Shuwei$

which starts the Linux and enter **bash**.

You can also start the Linux by searching **wsl** or **bash** on the Windows
Start Search Box and click on **wsl Run command** or **bash Run command**.

If the Linux is already running, you can run "bash" to enter the Linux:

>     PS C:\Users\Shuwei> wsl -l -v
>       NAME            STATE           VERSION
>     * Ubuntu-18.04    Running         2
>     PS C:\Users\Shuwei> bash
>     yesw2000@Home-Dell660:/mnt/c/Users/Shuwei$

After all terminals associated with the Linux have been closed, the running
Linux will stop then.

### <span id="Singularity_Installation_on_WSL2"></span> Singularity Installation on WSL2

Start the Linux distro on Windows, then install Singularity as the same ways as
on the Linux OS.

## <span id="Cache_Folders"></span> Cache Folders

To make downloading images for build and pull faster and less redundant,
Singularity uses a caching strategy. By default, Singularity will create a set
of **cache folders** in your **$HOME** directory for docker layers, Cloud
library images, and metadata, respectively:

- $HOME/.singularity/cache/library
- $HOME/.singularity/cache/oci
- $HOME/.singularity/cache/oci-tmp

which could take quite much space, depending the image size.

You can set the envvar **SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR** to use other directory than the
default cache directory **$HOME/.singularity/cache**.

## <span id="Binding_Paths_and_Mounts"></span> Binding Paths and Mounts

On default, Singularity will map the following directories on your host system
to directories within the container:

- $HOME
- $PWD
- /tmp
- /proc
- /sys
- /dev

You can bind additional directories with option **-B | --bind**, such as:

- `-B /data`: map /data on the host to /data on the container
- or `-B /usr/local/share:/share,/data` (please note the **comma delimiter**) :
  map /usr/local/share on the host to /share on the container, and map /data on
  the host to /data on the container.

You can also defined envvar **SINGULARITY_BINDPATH** (such as
`export SINGULARITY_BINDPATH="/data:/mnt"`) to bind paths.

## <span id="Examples"></span> Examples

You need define the envvar **SINGULARITY_CACHEDIR** to a directory to have
enough space to accommodate the Singularity cache.

### <span id="Some_Fun_Exercise_Examples"></span> Some Fun Exercise Examples

There are some fun exercises to play with the singularity command. One simple
example is "Hello World", which takes the container image from
[the Singularity container hub](https://singularity-hub.org/).

As you see, singularity need download and convert the docker image into a
singularity image file (sif) first.

Singularity version 3 also supports container images on
[the Singularity container library](https://cloud.sylabs.io/library), which is
not supported in Singularity version 2. Let us check what is the latest in the
Ubuntu container on the library:

>     lxplus$ singularity -q exec library://ubuntu cat /etc/os-release
>     NAME="Ubuntu"
>     VERSION="18.10 (Cosmic Cuttlefish)"
>     ID=ubuntu
>     ID_LIKE=debian
>     PRETTY_NAME="Ubuntu Cosmic Cuttlefish (development branch)"
>     VERSION_ID="18.10"
>     HOME_URL="https://www.ubuntu.com/"
>     SUPPORT_URL="https://help.ubuntu.com/"
>     BUG_REPORT_URL="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/"

### <span id="Using_Containers_for_LaTeX"></span> Using Containers for LaTeX

If you need LaTeX and do not have LaTeX installed locally, you can use LaTeX
container images.

Let us pull the image and convert into sif first, and use the converted image
locally:

There is another older PDFLaTex on the docker image hub, but with much more
packages installed.

Then you can process your tex file inside the container.

### <span id="Using_Containers_for_Machine_Lea"></span> Using Containers for Machine Learning

There are many containers available for machine learning.

For example, you can use sklearn containers.

> ```
> lxplus$  singularity pull sklearn.sif docker://fastgenomics/sklearn:0.19.1-p36-v5
> lxplus$  singularity shell sklearn.sif
> Singularity> python3
> >>> import sklearn
> >>> import pandas
> >>> import numpy
> >>> import scipy
> ```

Atlas also provides machine learning containers on CVMFS:

>     lxplus$ ls /cvmfs/unpacked.cern.ch/registry.hub.docker.com/atlasml
>
>     atlasml-base:latest    ml-base:centos           ml-base:py-3.6.8
>     atlasml-base:py-3.6.8  ml-base:centos-py-3.6.8  ml-base:py-3.7.2
>     atlasml-base:py-3.7.2  ml-base:centos-py-3.7.2
>     ml-base:bionic         ml-base:latest
>     singularity shell /cvmfs/unpacked.cern.ch/registry.hub.docker.com/atlasml/atlasml-base:py-3.7.2
>     Singularity> python3
>     >>> import sklearn
>     >>> import torch

As the container path `/cvmfs/unpacked.cern.ch/registry.hub.docker.com/atlasml/`
indicates, the above container is also available on the docker hub via
**docker://**. But it would take quite a while (about an hour) to pull the
container from the docker hub and convert into a singularity image file (sif).

## <span id="Using_Containers_through_ARLB"></span> Using Containers through ARLB

Prior to use ATLAS_LOCAL_ROOT_BASE (ALRB), you need install CVMFS first. Please
refer to
[the CernVM-FS Client Quick Start](https://cernvm.cern.ch/portal/filesystem/quickstart)
at CERN for CVMFS installation guide.

Then define the command **setupATLAS** as follows:

    export ATLAS_LOCAL_ROOT_BASE=/cvmfs/atlas.cern.ch/repo/ATLASLocalRootBase
    alias setupATLAS='source ${ATLAS_LOCAL_ROOT_BASE}/user/atlasLocalSetup.sh'

The option **-c** in the command **setupATLAS** takes container location or
container keyword such as **slc5**, **slc6**, **centos6**, or **centos7**.
Please check
[ALRB Containers](https://twiki.atlas-canada.ca/bin/view/AtlasCanada/Containers)
for more details.

For example, start a centos7 container with ALRB setup:

>     lxplus$ setupATLAS  -c centos7
>     ------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you do not need either ALRB or CVMFS, then run with tag **+noalrb** and
**+nocvmfs** after the image location/keyword:

>     lxplus$ setupATLAS  -c centos7+noalrb+nocvmfs
>     ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
>     Singularity: 3.5.3
>     From: /usr/bin/singularity

>     ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
>     Singularity>

If you like to start a Ubuntu OS without ALRB but with CVMFS, then run with tag
**+noalrb** after the mage location/keyword:

>     lxplus$ setupATLAS -c library://ubuntu+noalrb
>     INFO:    Convert SIF file to sandbox...
>     INFO:    Cleaning up image...

That is, start the wanted container, then source /home/atlas/release_setup.sh.

## <span id="Containers_on_Docker_Hub"></span> Containers on Docker Hub

The Docker hub hosts the largest container images. You can input keyword to
[search on the hub](https://hub.docker.com/search/?q=rust&type=image). For
example, you can put a keyword "atlas/" under the search field as shown below:

- A screenshot of searching for "Atlas/" on the Docker Hub:
  ![](./DockerHub-Atlas.jpg)

Click on the found container, it will provides the pull command instruction and
sometimes also a brief description.

## <span id="Containers_on_Singularity_Hub_an"></span> Containers on Singularity Hub and Library

There are many container images on the Singularity Hub and Library.

- Singularity Hub: <https://singularity-hub.org/>. Click "Collections" on the
  top menu to search by **Label**, **Tag** or **App** name.
- Singularity Library: <https://cloud.sylabs.io/library>. It is not supported in
  Singularity version 2. Put keyword in the search field on the very top to
  search for your wanted container.

# <span id="Contained_based_Jobs_on_the_Grid"></span> Contained-based Jobs on the Grid

There are more resources available on the grid, you can run container-based jobs
on the grid. Both prun and pathena provide an option **--containerImage** to
allow jobs to run inside a specified container on the grid. Check the following
page for more details:

<https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/PanDA/PandaRun#Run_user_containers_jobs>

You can also run **prun --helpGroup=containerJob** for more container-related
options.

Please note that you should test your job interactively first as documented
above, prior to submitting them to the grid.
